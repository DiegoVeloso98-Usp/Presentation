                   Modeling of Brittle Fracture under Cyclic Loading},
  year =          {2024},
  abstract =      {Despite the attention devoted to phase-field modeling
                   of brittle fracture in the last 20 years, there are
                   still some open issues. Among these, the search for a
                   physically reasonable and computationally feasible
                   criterion to split the energy density into parcels
                   that may or may not contribute to crack propagation
                   has been the subject of many recent studies. Within
                   this context, we propose an energy split -- or energy
                   decomposition -- with the aim of representing as
                   accurately as possible the mechanical behavior of a
                   crack under cyclic loading. To this purpose, two key
                   assumptions are made. The first one is the
                   interpretation of the gradient damage direction as
                   being equivalent to the normal-to-crack direction, as
                   already known by the literature. The second
                   assumption is to consider the sign of the projection
                   of the strain tensor on the normal-to-crack
                   directions at a point as an indicator of whether this
                   point should behave as an open or as a closed crack.
                   We associate the latter case to both (a) a complete
                   recovery of elastic energy density and (b) a zero
                   driving force at such point. The first case is
                   treated classically as a damageable material point at
                   which the crack is free to propagate. Four examples
                   are presented in order to assess the suitability of
                   the present model by using both AT1 and AT2
                   regularization models. Results show the desired
                   effect of limiting crack propagation to tension as
                   well as of recovering its intact stiffness upon load
                   reversal, even when the two most known energy splits
                   fail to. Finally, the simplicity and effectiveness of
                   our approach may pave the way to more sophisticated
                   idealizations and to complex large-scale
                   applications.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a computationally efficient and explicit algorithm for the rigorous enforcement of the irreversibility constraint in the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture is presented. The proposed approach is staggered and relies on the alternate minimization of the total energy functional. The phase-field evolution turns out to be governed by a complementarity boundary-value problem, where the complementarity stems from the irreversibility, while the boundary-value problem is originated by the presence of the gradient term in the phase-field functional. Several different techniques have been proposed in the literature to account for damage irreversibility in a computationally effective way. Following a similar approach proposed in the past for a gradient-plasticity problem, a particularly simple and effective solution strategy based on the Projected Successive Over-Relaxation (PSOR) method for constrained optimization, where an iterative explicit scheme is used for the solution of symmetric linear complementarity problems, is presented. Even though the proposed method is restricted to linear complementarity problems, it can be applied to the numerical simulation of a wide range of problems discussed in the literature. The performance of the suggested solution algorithm on a number of test cases is compared with that of a recently proposed penalty approach for the approximated enforcement of irreversibility.},

These research works have contributed to the development of the PFM from different perspectives, especially in connection with the mathematical formulations of the hydro-mechanical processes and the numerical algorithms to solve the emerging coupled problems. In this regard, the underlying paper aims to review the significant scientific works that utilized the PFM to model fracturing caused mainly by fluid injection in a certain porous domain and, less common, by fluid extraction (e.g., drying) from a certain porous domain. This includes reviewing different approaches for deriving the phase-field evolution formulation (e.g. Ginzburg–Landau approach, thermodynamically consistent approaches, and microforce-based approach) and reviewing several formulations for the stiffness degradation function and that of the crack driving force. Besides, the paper will go through several methods to estimate the crack aperture width, in addition to reviewing different numerical approaches and implementations. The paper will be concluded by presenting a number of open topics and challenges to be addressed in future works.},

            Continuum mechanics of Solids presents a unified treatment of the major concepts in Solid Mechanics for beginning graduate students in the many branches of engineering. The fundamental topics of kinematics in finite and infinitesimal deformation, mechanical and thermodynamic balances plus entropy imbalance in the small strain setting are covered as they apply to all solids. The major material models of Elasticity, Viscoelasticity, and Plasticity are detailed and models for Fracture and Fatigue are discussed. In addition to these topics in Solid Mechanics, because of the growing need for engineering students to have a knowledge of the coupled multi-physics response of materials in modern technologies related to the environment and energy, the book also includes chapters on Thermoelasticity, Chemoelasticity, Poroelasticity, and Piezoelectricity. A preview to the theory of finite elasticity and elastomeric materials is also given. Throughout, example computations are presented to highlight how the developed theories may be applied.},

  abstract =      {Being one of the most promising candidates for the
                   modeling of localized failure in solids, so far the
                   phase-field method has been applied only to brittle
                   fracture with very few exceptions. In this work, a
                   unified phase-field theory for the mechanics of
                   damage and quasi-brittle failure is proposed within
                   the framework of thermodynamics. Specifically, the
                   crack phase-field and its gradient are introduced to
                   regularize the sharp crack topology in a purely
                   geometric context. The energy dissipation functional
                   due to crack evolution and the stored energy
                   functional of the bulk are characterized by a crack
                   geometric function of polynomial type and an
                   energetic degradation function of rational type,
                   respectively. Standard arguments of thermodynamics
                   then yield the macroscopic balance equation coupled
                   with an extra evolution law of gradient type for the
                   crack phase-field, governed by the aforesaid
                   constitutive functions. The classical phase-field
                   models for brittle fracture are recovered as
                   particular examples. More importantly, the
                   constitutive functions optimal for quasi-brittle
                   failure are determined such that the proposed
                   phase-field theory converges to a cohesive zone model
                   for a vanishing length scale. Those general softening
                   laws frequently adopted for quasi-brittle failure,
                   e.g., linear, exponential, hyperbolic and Cornelissen
                   et al. (1986) ones, etc., can be reproduced or fit
                   with high precision. Except for the internal length
                   scale, all the other model parameters can be
                   determined from standard material properties (i.e.,
                   Young's modulus, failure strength, fracture energy
                   and the target softening law). Some representative
                   numerical examples are presented for the validation.
                   It is found that both the internal length scale and
                   the mesh size have little influences on the overall
                   global responses, so long as the former can be well
                   resolved by sufficiently fine mesh. In particular,
                   for the benchmark tests of concrete the numerical
                   results of load versus displacement curve and crack
                   paths both agree well with the experimental data,

	abstract = {Unlike the description of cracks as sharp surfaces which requires different criteria to predict the onset of crack propagation, the direction of crack growth, possible crack branching, and the nucleation of new cracks, the phase ﬁeld approach provides a holistic description of all these fracture processes. The phase ﬁeld order parameter is used to differentiate between broken and undamaged material, and the entire crack evolution is obtained implicitly by solving the evolution equation of the order parameter which is coupled to the mechanical ﬁeld equations. A so called degradation function couples the order parameter to the elastic properties of the material in order to model the change in stiffness between fractured and undamaged material. The nucleation of a new crack in originally undamaged material is preceded by a localization of the fracture ﬁeld. Before the onset of this localization the material response of the phase ﬁeld fracture model is mainly controlled by the degradation function. However, the degradation function frequently found in the literature yields a pronounced softening behavior before the onset of fracture which is not desirable when modeling brittle materials. In this work we discuss the potential of alternative degradation functions in the context of crack nucleation and propagation.},

  abstract =      {In the course of an investigation of the effect of
                   surface scratches on the mechanical strength of
                   solids, some general conclusions were reached which
                   appear to have a direct bearing on the problem of
                   rupture, from an engineering standpoint, and also on
                   the larger question of the nature of intermolecular
                   cohesion. The original object of the work, which was
                   carried out at the Royal Aircraft Estab\-lishment,
                   was the discovery of the effect of surface
                   treatment---such as, for instance, filing, grinding
                   or polishing---on the strength of metallic machine
                   parts subjected to alternating or repeated loads. In
                   the case of steel, and some other metals in common
                   use, the results of fatigue tests indicated that the
                   range of alternating stress which could be
                   permanently sustained by the material was smaller
                   than the range within which it was sensibly elastic,
                   after being subjected to a great number of reversals.
                   Hence it was inferred that the safe range of loading
                   of a part, having a scratched or grooved surface of a
                   given type, should be capable of estimation with the
                   help of one of the two hypotheses of rupture commonly
                   used for solids which are elastic to fracture.
                   According to these hypotheses rupture may be expected
                   if (a) the maximum tensile stress, (b) the maximum
                   extension, exceeds a certain critical value.
                   Moreover, as the behaviour of the materials under
                   consideration, within the safe range of alternating
                   stress, shows very little departure from Hooke's law,
                   it was thought that the necessary stress and strain
                   calculations could be performed by means of the
                   mathematical theory of elasticity.},

                   J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319--1342]. We focus
                   on the linear elastic case where the contact
                   condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on
                   the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The
                   regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain
                   energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and
                   accounting for the sign of the local volume change.
                   The numerical implementation is based on a standard
                   finite element discretization and on the adaptation
                   of an alternate minimization algorithm used in
                   previous works. The new regularization avoids crack
                   interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in
                   traction and in compression. Even though we do not

  abstract =      {Abstract Phase-field models of brittle fracture are
                   typically endowed with a decomposition of the elastic
                   strain energy density in order to realistically
                   describe fracture under multi-axial stress states. In
                   this contribution, we identify the essential
                   requirements for this decomposition to correctly
                   describe both nucleation and propagation of cracks.
                   Discussing the evolution of the elastic domains in
                   the strain and stress spaces as damage evolves, we
                   highlight the links between the nucleation and
                   propagation conditions and the modulation of the
                   elastic energy with the phase-field variable. In
                   light of the identified requirements, we review some
                   of the existing energy decompositions, showcasing
                   their merits and limitations, and conclude that none
                   of them is able to fulfil all requirements. As a
                   partial remedy to this outcome, we propose a new
                   energy decomposition, denoted as star-convex model,
                   which involves a minimal modification of the
                   volumetric-deviatoric decomposition. Predictions of
                   the star-convex model are compared with those of the
                   existing models with different numerical tests
                   encompassing both nucleation and propagation.},

                   describe the state of the material between intact and
                   fully broken. So far, for the loading dependent
                   degradation of stiffness (damage) either the
                   volumetric-deviatoric split of strain [1, 2] or the
                   spectral decomposition [3, 4] is used. In contrast to
                   such an isotropic degradation of stiffness, the fully
                   broken state represents a crack with a particular
                   orientation. Both aforementioned approaches do not
                   take the crack orientation into account. This may
                   lead to the violation of the crack boundary

                   components are subjected to increasingly demanding
                   operating conditions, especially the high pressure
                   turbine (HPT) blades. Such conditions cause these
                   parts to undergo different types of time-dependent
                   degradation, one of which is creep. A model using the
                   finite element method (FEM) was developed, in order
                   to be able to predict the creep behaviour of HPT
                   blades. Flight data records (FDR) for a specific
                   aircraft, provided by a commercial aviation company,
                   were used to obtain thermal and mechanical data for
                   three different flight cycles. In order to create the
                   3D model needed for the FEM analysis, a HPT blade
                   scrap was scanned, and its chemical composition and
                   material properties were obtained. The data that was
                   gathered was fed into the FEM model and different
                   simulations were run, first with a simplified 3D
                   rectangular block shape, in order to better establish
                   the model, and then with the real 3D mesh obtained
                   from the blade scrap. The overall expected behaviour
                   in terms of displacement was observed, in particular
                   at the trailing edge of the blade. Therefore such a
                   model can be useful in the goal of predicting turbine
                   blade life, given a set of FDR data.},

                   Furthermore, when this anisotropy is strong, the

                   anisotropic material behavior at small and large
                   deformations is outlined within this work. Most
                   existing fracture phase field models assume crack
                   evolution within isotropic solids, which is not a
                   meaningful assumption for many natural as well as
                   engineered materials that exhibit
                   orientation-dependent behavior. The incorporation of
                   anisotropy into fracture phase field models is for
                   example necessary to properly describe the typical
                   sawtooth crack patterns in strongly anisotropic
                   materials. In the present contribution, anisotropy is
                   incorporated in fracture phase field models in
                   several ways: (i) Within a pure geometrical approach,
                   the crack surface density function is adopted by a
                   rigorous application of the theory of tensor
                   invariants leading to the definition of structural
                   tensors of second and fourth order. In this work we
                   employ structural tensors to describe transverse
                   isotropy, orthotropy and cubic anisotropy. Latter
                   makes the incorporation of second gradients of the
                   crack phase field necessary, which is treated within
                   the finite element context by a nonconforming Morley
                   triangle. Practically, such a geometric approach
                   manifests itself in the definition of anisotropic

	abstract = {Within this contribution, we present a diffuse interface approach for the simulation of crack nucleation and growth in materials, which incorporates an orientation dependency of the fracture toughness. After outlining the basic motivation for the model from an engineering standpoint, the phase field paradigm for fracture is introduced. Further, a specific phase field model for brittle fracture is reviewed, where we focus on the meaning of the auxiliary parameter differentiating between material phases and the coupling of such a parameter to continuum equations in order to obtain the characteristic self organizing model properties. This specific model, as will be explained, provides the phenomenological and methodical basis for the presented enhancement. The formulation of an appropriate evolution equation in terms of a Ginzburg-Landau type equation will be highlighted and several comments on sharp interface models will be made to present a brief comparison. Following up on the basics we then introduce the formulation of a modified version of the model, which additionally to the handling of cracks in linear elastic materials under quasi static loading is also capable of taking into account the effect of resistance variation with respect to the potential crack extension direction. The strong and also the weak forms of the respective governing equations corresponding to the developed anisotropic phase field model are presented. Utilizing the weak formulation as starting point for the discretization of the two fields (displacement field and the phase field), the computational framework in terms of finite elements is introduced. We finally explain several test cases investigated within simulations and discuss the corresponding numerical results. Besides examples, which are set up to illustrate the general model properties, a comparison with crack paths obtained by experimental investigations will be presented in order to show the potential of the developed phase field model.},

It leads for instance to complex failure behaviours and crack paths in polycrystalline or architected materials. This paper focuses on modelling anisotropy of brittle fracture by means of a variational phase-field approach. More precisely, we study different models including several phase (or damage) variables corresponding to different damage mechanisms. First, we recall a multi-mechanism gradient damage model based on an anisotropic non-local fracture energy. We then consider a model accounting for an anisotropic degradation of the elasticity stiffness tensor. Both types of anisotropies are compared in terms of their influence on analytical homogeneous solutions under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loadings. Weak and strong anisotropies are captured via the chosen multi-mechanism damage framework. The models are implemented numerically by using a finite element discretization. In order to improve numerical performance, we implement an algorithm based on a hybrid direct–iterative resolution of the displacement sub-problem. Accuracy of model prediction is assessed by comparing numerical results to theoretical solutions under uniaxial loading. Benchmark numerical tests on notched and perforated plates highlight the role of material parameters on the fracture anisotropy. Furthermore, both models are able to retrieve zig-zag crack patterns observed in prior numerical and experimental studies. Finally, we discuss the predictions of a model combining both types of anisotropies.},

However, various decomposition methods have been proposed in the literature, and it can be difficult to determine an appropriate method for a given problem. The goal of this work is to facilitate the choice of strain decomposition method by assessing the performance of three existing methods (spectral decomposition of the stress or the strain and deviatoric decomposition of the strain) and one new method (deviatoric decomposition of the stress) with several benchmark problems. In each benchmark problem, we compare the performance of the four methods using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. In the first benchmark, we compare the predicted mechanical behavior of cracked material. We then use four quasi-static benchmark cases: a single edge notched tension test, a single edge notched shear test, a three-point bending test, and a L-shaped panel test. Finally, we use two dynamic benchmark cases: a dynamic tensile fracture test and a dynamic shear fracture test. All four methods perform well in tension, the two spectral methods perform better in compression and with mixed mode (though the stress spectral method performs the best), and all the methods show minor issues in at least one of the shear cases. In general, whether the strain or the stress is decomposed does not have a significant impact on the predicted behavior.},

	abstract = {Anisotropy is inherent in many materials, either because of the manufacturing process, or due to their microstructure, and can markedly inﬂuence the failure behavior. Anisotropic materials obviously possess both anisotropic elasticity and anisotropic fracture surface energy. Phase-ﬁeld methods are elegant and mathematically well-grounded, and have become popular for simulating isotropic and anisotropic brittle fracture. Here, we developed a variational phase-ﬁeld model for strongly anisotropic fracture, which accounts for the anisotropy both in elastic strain energy and in fracture surface energy, and the asymmetric behavior of cracks in traction and in compression. We implement numerically our higher-order phase-ﬁeld model with mixed ﬁnite element, inspired by formulations for plate/shell elements, where similar continuity requirements exist. For strongly anisotropic materials, as reported in the recent experiments, one could obtain several crack propagation directions for a given loading conﬁguration, depending on imperfections of the initial crack. From an energy point of view, the selection of crack propagation direction is dictated by local principle of the generalized maximum energy release rate. Herein, for the ﬁrst time we examine numerically this local principle, reproduce the crack behaviors observed in recent experiments. Numerical simulations exhibit all the features of strongly anisotropic fracture.},

	abstract = {An adaptive phase-field method is developed and applied to model fracture propagation in orthotropic composites. The proposed approach extends the work of Muixí et al. (2020) to orthotropic composites through following modifications: (a) elastic tensor is evaluated in the global coordinate system from a given engineering stiffness matrix in the principal material coordinates, (b) strain energy density is additively decomposed into fiber and matrix-dominated modes, and (c) a penalized second-order structural tensor is introduced in the phase-field equation facilitating preferential damage growth along the fiber orientation. The developed approach is validated through several benchmark examples and available experimental results. Several numerical failure experiments are conducted varying fiber orientation, adhesive layer thickness, shear modulus, and fracture toughness. A large increase in ductility and peakload carrying capacity is observed for laminate configurations where the fibers are oriented such that the principal material coordinates and the global coordinates are aligned. An increase in the adhesive layer’s fracture toughness increases the macroscopic ductility and prevents catastrophic failure of laminate. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the failure mechanisms in orthotropic composites.},

	abstract = {Rock formations are known to exhibit material anisotropy, both in terms of elastic and fracture properties. This means that the fracture path in such formations is not a priori known but rather a complex unknown that requires robust numerical techniques to predict accurately. In this context, the phase-field model is considered particularly effective, provided that certain physical considerations are carefully adjusted to align with the physics of the problem. While addressing elastic anisotropy is well-established, the tension–compression asymmetry necessary to inhibit crack interpenetration in phase-field fracture models needs to account for the specific material anisotropy. Additionally, to accurately capture crack propagation, it is critical to simultaneously account for orientation-dependent fracture toughness in such materials. To address this, the present study employs an anisotropic phase-field model that integrates the generalized spectral decomposition proposed in the literature for orthotropic materials with a two-fold symmetric fracture toughness, to predict the fracture trajectories in rock-type samples under fixed mixed-mode loading ratios. While each of the two aspects has primarily been applied to model orthotropic plates under simple tensile and shearing loading conditions in the literature, here we study their applicability in complex loading scenarios. To this end, the experimental data from notched semi-circular specimens of Grimsel Granite undergoing complex mixed-mode loading obtained in our previous work is considered. We focus on two given mode-mixity ratios and perform numerical studies. Our results emphasize the importance of considering this generalized decomposition for phase-field modeling of fracturing in rocktype materials, particularly under loading conditions where the crack might otherwise be unrealistically driven into the compressive region. Although certain features are well captured by considering anisotropy in elasticity alone, our findings demonstrate that incorporating a two-fold symmetric fracture toughness proves to be advantageous for more precise tracking of the fracture path.},

	abstract = {Many real-world computations involve sparse data structures in the form of sparse matrices. A common strategy for optimizing sparse matrix operations is to reorder a matrix to improve data locality. However, it’s not always clear whether reordering will provide benefits over the unordered matrix, as its effectiveness depends on several factors, such as structural features of the matrix, the reordering algorithm and the hardware that is used. This paper aims to establish the relationship between matrix reordering algorithms and the performance of sparse matrix operations. We thoroughly evaluate six different matrix reordering algorithms on 490 matrices across eight multicore architectures, focusing on the commonly used sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) kernel. We find that reordering based on graph partitioning provides better SpMV performance than the alternatives for a large majority of matrices, and that the resulting performance is explained through a combination of data locality and load balancing concerns.},

                   of the strain energy density into tensile and
                   compressive parts are often necessary to avoid
                   interpenetration of cracked surfaces and to select
                   physically trustworthy crack paths. General
                   formulations accounting for orthotropy of the
                   well-known spectral and hydrostatic-deviatoric
                   decompositions of the strain tensor (often referred
                   to as Miehe and Amor decompositions) are presented in
                   this study. Additionally, a new principal energy
                   decomposition based on spectral decomposition of the
                   stiffness tensor is proposed for general anisotropic
                   materials. The decompositions are evaluated
                   numerically in a quadratic specimen with an initial
                   stationary edge crack subject to both tensile and
                   shear global remote loading. It is shown that when an
                   isotropic case is considered, solutions agree well
                   with results reported elsewhere for both the spectral
                   and the hydrostatic-deviatoric approaches. The
                   principal energy decomposition results in similar
                   crack paths as the other approaches, with only subtle
                   differences. When orthotropy is considered, however,
                   significant differences in the resulting crack paths
                   as well as global force-displacement behavior are
                   obtained, especially when the crack is subjected to
                   shear loading. For global tensile loading, the
                   decompositions result in similar crack paths and
                   force-displacement relations. The results provide a
                   step forward when developing phase-field fracture
                   theories for brittle materials with an orthotropic
                   nature and highlight the importance of a proper

                   arbitrary anisotropic elastic behavior in a
                   three-dimensional setting. On this basis, we
                   generalize two existing models for
                   tension--compression asymmetry in isotropic
                   materials, namely the `volumetric--deviatoric' model
                   (Amor et al., 2009) and the `no-tension' model
                   (Freddi and Royer-Carfagni, 2010), towards materials
                   with anisotropic nature. Two benchmark problems,
                   single notched tensile and shear tests, are used to
                   study the performance of the present model. The

	abstract = {The phase-field fracture free-energy functional is non-convex with respect to the displacement and the phase field. This results in a poor performance of the conventional monolithic solvers like the Newton–Raphson method. In order to circumvent this issue, researchers opt for the alternate minimization (staggered) solvers. Staggered solvers are robust for the phase-field based fracture simulations as the displacement and the phase-field sub-problems are convex in nature. Nevertheless, the staggered solver requires very large number of iterations (of the order of thousands) to converge. In this work, a robust monolithic solver is presented for the phase-field fracture problem. The solver adopts a fracture energy-based arc-length method and an adaptive under-relaxation scheme. The arc-length method enables the simulation to overcome critical points (snap-back, snap-through instabilities) during the loading of a specimen. The use of an under-relaxation scheme stabilizes the solver by preventing the divergence due to an ill-behaving stiffness matrix. The efficiency of the proposed solver is further amplified with an adaptive mesh refinement scheme based on PHT-splines within the framework of isogeometric analysis. The numerical experiments presented in the manuscript demonstrate the efficacy of the solver.
